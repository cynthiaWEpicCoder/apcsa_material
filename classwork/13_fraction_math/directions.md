## Fraction Math

For this exercise, you have the class called FractionMath that will handle adding and multiplying fractions.

Write the Fraction class. Your job is to complete the Fraction class based on the structure that is set up. To do this, you will need to use the this notation in your constructor and setters. You will also need to use it to pass the object to the FractionMath class.

The Driver is complete and can be used to test your objects. Feel free to make changes in this class to test other things.
